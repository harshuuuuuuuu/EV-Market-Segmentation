## Introduction

Welcome to the EV Market Segmentation project repository! This project aims to explore and segment an electric vehicle market dataset using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Market segmentation is a critical aspect of understanding consumer behavior, enabling businesses to target their audience effectively.

In this repository, you will find code, data, and documentation related to the project. This README provides an overview of the project, its components, and instructions for usage.

## Data

The project's dataset is contained in the file `EV Segmentation.ipynb`. This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and analysis of the electric vehicle market data. The dataset used can be downloaded from Kaggle : ![data_1]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karivedha/indian-consumers-cars-purchasing-behaviour), ![data_2]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalturare/ev-cars-available-in-india-till-oct2021)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) is documented in the Jupyter Notebook file `EV Segmentation.ipynb`. This notebook provides insights into the initial data exploration, including summary statistics, data visualization, and key findings.

## Market Segmentation

The primary focus of this project is market segmentation. The segmentation analysis and results are available in the same Jupyter Notebook file `EV Segmentation.ipynb`. This section outlines the methodology and outcomes of the segmentation process.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshuuuuuuuu/EV-Market-Segmentation.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
3. Access the dataset separately and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file (EV Segmentation.ipynb).

4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file to explore the dataset and analyze market segmentation.
